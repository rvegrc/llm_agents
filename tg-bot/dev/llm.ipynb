      "I think about Brazil first because it's often mentioned as one of the bigger capitals. They have Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba, but I'm not sure which one is the capital. Maybe it's Rio? I've heard that some people prefer Rio for its proximity to the sea, so maybe that's why it's considered a main capital.\n",

      "Then there's Japan. I remember hearing about Tokyo as the capital before 2019. But wait, in 2019, they changed it to Osaka. That must have been a big decision by the government. So, does the current capital of Japan still use the old name? I'm not sure if the city names change every few years or if there's a more permanent one.\n",

      "I should also think about any other capitals that might be nearby. For example, maybe Osaka is closer to Tokyo and some parts of Japan. But since it changed to Osaka in 2019, I don't think\n"
